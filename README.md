# GRAPPA Student Seminar 2018

This repository provides an overview and useful material for the GRAPPA Student Seminar 2018.

There are 4 groups, each covering a different topic in the field of Dark Matter:

* Group 1 - Cosmology
* Group 2 - Candidates
* Group 3 - Indirect detection
* Group 4 - Direct detection

Each group is expected to write a review section of the Dark Matter wiki: [http://www.darkmatterwiki.net/](http://www.darkmatterwiki.net/).

In association with this, each group is also expected to write a number of scripts performing useful calculations. More details can be found in the `scripts_info/` folder. Note, however, that the scripts themselves should be placed in the relevant GitHub repositories for your group:

* Group 1 (Cosmology): [GSS2018_Cosmology](https://github.com/bradkav/GSS2018_Cosmology)
* Group 2 (Candidates): [GSS2018_Candidates](https://github.com/bradkav/GSS2018_Candidates)
* Group 3 (Indirect Detection): [GSS2018_Indirect](https://github.com/bradkav/GSS2018_Indirect)
* Group 4 (Direct Detection): [GSS2018_Direct](https://github.com/bradkav/GSS2018_Direct)
