# GRAPPA Student Seminar 2018

Each group will produce a set of scripts, providing useful Dark Matter-related calculations associated with the topics we have worked on in the seminars. The groups and topics are as follows:

* Group 1 (Cosmology): Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)
* Group 2 (Candidates): Freeze-out of Dark Matter particles
* Group 3 (Indirect detection): Astrophysical J-factors
* Group 4 (Direct detection): Nuclear recoil rates

Below, we give more detailed guidance concerning what we're looking for and some sensible steps to get you started. We also give some general advice for preparing and maintaining the scripts and using the GitHub repositories.

## General Advice

...

## Group 1 (Cosmology) - CMB

A good reference to start with is [arXiv:0802.3688](https://arxiv.org/abs/0802.3688). See also [this pedagogical discussion](http://background.uchicago.edu/index.html) on Wayne Hu's website. 

#### Checkpoints

#### Outputs

* Plot showing the size and shape of the acoustic oscillations in the potential, with and without baryons
* Plot showing the CMB anisotropies for a number of different 'cosmological scenarios' (no dark matter, all dark matter, no cosmological constant, etc.)

## Group 2 (Candidates) - Freeze-out

A good reference to start with is the book [Modern Cosmology (2013)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/book/9780122191411) by Scott Dodelson, in particular Chapter 3.

#### Checkpoints

#### Outputs

* Plot demonstrating the freeze-out process, showing the number density of particles n/T^3 as a function of the temperature of the Universe, m/T.
* Plot showing the relic abundance as a function of the particle mass and annihilation cross section.

## Group 3 (Indirect detection) - Astrophysical J-factors

A good reference to start with is [arXiv:1604.00014](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.00014).

#### Checkpoints


#### Outputs

* A plot showing the range of possible DM density profiles near the Galactic Centre.
* A plot showing the J-factors for DM annihilation (and decay) as a function of opening angle.
* A plot comparing J-factors from different sources (Galactic Centre, Dwarf Galaxies, Clusters).

## Group 4 (Direct detection) - Nuclear recoil rates

A good reference to start with is [arXiv:1002.1912](https://arxiv.org/abs/1002.1912).

#### Checkpoints



#### Outputs

* Plot showing the Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity distribution of Dark Matter
* Plot showing the nuclear recoil spectra dR/dE for a range of nuclear targets (Xe, Ar, Ge) and for a range of DM masses
* Plot showing the total number of signal events in different detectors, as a function of energy threshold.
